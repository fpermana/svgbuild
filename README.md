SVGBuild is an open source python script that was created by Ed Halley in 2008 (http://halley.cc/code/).
By default it could be used to produce sequence of images from an Inkscape's SVG files.
These sequence of images later could be used to create video.
For example on this link [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/xWQWbbvYvlg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWQWbbvYvlg). I modified that python script, create GUI and gave additional features and functions so it can be used to create videos like on [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/TUOR9AXcyF4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUOR9AXcyF4), [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/whgeRYBKRCE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whgeRYBKRCE), and more.
