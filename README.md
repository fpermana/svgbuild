SVGBuild is an open source python script that was created by Ed Halley in 2008 (http://halley.cc/code/).
By default it could be used to produce sequence of images from an Inkscape's SVG files.
These sequence of images later could be used to create video.

I modified that python script, create GUI and gave additional features and functions so it can be used to create videos like on <br/>
